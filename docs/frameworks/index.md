## Available Frameworks

### [GLiNER](frameworks/gliner)
A token classification framework optimized for **Named Entity Recognition** (NER).
- Effective across text classification, QA, NER, Relation Extraction. 
- Supports few-shot and zero-shot entity extraction  
- Works with custom and overlapping entity types  
- Multiple architecture types

---

### GLiClass  
A simplified framework for **text classification**, focused on minimal setup and high efficiency.
- Supports few-shot and zero-shot text classification
- Fast inference  
- Multi-label and multi-class support  
- Multiple architecture types


---

### LiqFit  
A flexible framework for **few-shot learning** of cross-encoder models using **natural language inference (NLI)**.  
- Effective across text classification, QA, NER, and more  
- Minimal data requirements (as few as 8 examples per label)  
- Built-in support for DeBERTa, T5, and custom heads
