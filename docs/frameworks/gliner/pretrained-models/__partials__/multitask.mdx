### Classification
   ```python
   from gliner import GLiNER
   from gliner.multitask import GLiNERClassifier

   model_id = 'knowledgator/gliner-multitask-v1.0'
   model = GLiNER.from_pretrained(model_id)
   classifier = GLiNERClassifier(model=model)
   text = "SpaceX successfully launched a new rocket into orbit."
   labels = ['science', 'technology', 'business', 'sports']
   predictions = classifier(text, classes=labels, multi_label=False)
   print(predictions)
   ```

    <summary>Expected Output</summary>
    ```bash
    [[{'label': 'technology', 'score': 0.3839840292930603}]]
    ```

### Question-Answering
   ```python
   from gliner import GLiNER
   from gliner.multitask import GLiNERQuestionAnswerer

   model_id = 'knowledgator/gliner-multitask-v1.0'

   model_id = 'knowledgator/gliner-multitask-v1.0'
   model = GLiNER.from_pretrained(model_id)
   summarizer = GLiNERSummarizer(model=model)
   text = "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."
   summary = summarizer(text, threshold=0.1)
