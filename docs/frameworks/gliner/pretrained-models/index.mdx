Widely  regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won  five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the    Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European  player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league  titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and  the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances  (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in    the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and  international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have    made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield   player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club  and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.
