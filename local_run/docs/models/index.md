## Model Categories

### Multi-task  
Models capable of handling multiple NLP tasks simultaneously — ideal for pipelines requiring shared representations across domains.

### NER (Named Entity Recognition)  
Extract domain-specific entities with high precision using models fine-tuned for biomedical, legal, and general-purpose use cases.

### Text Classification  
Classify text into topics, sentiments, or intents. Includes:

- **ComprehendIt** – A general-purpose, zero-shot NLI-based classifier.
- **GLiClass** – A lightweight, fast model for resource-constrained environments.

### Chemical Models  
Specialized models for chemical domain tasks such as converting between SMILES and IUPAC names.
